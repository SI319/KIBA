# Binding affinity files
For davis dataset, standard value is Kd in nM. In the article, we used the transformation below:
pK_{d} = -log_{10}\frac{K_d}{1e9}

For KIBA dataset, standard value is KIBA score. Two versions of the binding affinity value txt files correspond the original values and transformed values (more information here). In the article tranformed values are used.

nan values indicate there is no experimental value for that drug-target pair.
